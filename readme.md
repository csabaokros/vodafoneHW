Hi! This is my solution to the homework for Vodafone's frontend dev position. Here's how to use it:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` or `npm i` in the project folder
3. Wait for npm to finish fetching dependencies
4. Run `npm run serve`

Optionally you can use `npm run test:unit` to run unit tests.

Thanks for checking this out!
